## C_Pgm_To_Print_in_Different_format

### Introduction
##### The Popular programming languages like C use the compiler to convert high-level language instructions into low-level language instructions. A compiler is a program that converts high-level language instructions into low-level language instructions The compiler performs two things, first it verifies the program errors, if errors are found, it returns a list of errors otherwise it converts the complete code into the low-level language. 

### Objective
##### Program to print a '*' in the perticular bits for the binary 1 and binary 0 should be printed as'_'for the given input number.
##### It should be started from the LHS and continuing to RHS.

### Steps to Execute the Program
##### C program file (Source file) must save with .c extension.
##### The compiler converts complete program at a time from high-level language to low-level language.
##### Input to the compiler is .c file and output from the compiler is .exe file, but it also generates .obj file in this process.
##### The compiler converts the file only if there are no errors in the source code.
##### CPU places the result in User Screen window.

### Overall Process
##### Type the program in C editor and save with .c extension (Press F2 to save).
##### Press Alt + F9 to compile the program.
##### If there are errors, correct the errors and recompile the program.
##### If there are no errors, then press Ctrl + F9 to execute/run the program.
##### Press Alt + F5 to open User Screen and check the result.
